package com.robertx22.age_of_exile.aoe_data;

// When my refactors are done, NONE of the code in this package should ever run outside of dev environment!
// To the point i should be able to make it a separate mod entirely, the AOE Data Generators mod.
// Ofc that is too much effort for just an error check, so having it as a separate package is good enough.

// EDIT: currently data stats are the only exception, they were TOO hard coded so it will take me a while to
// replace all stat instances with identifiers..
