A lot of these assets are either Paid or gotten somewhere for free or under attribution licences.

I have stopped placing them all in 1 paidassets folder as it screwed my organization as i have a mix or paid and free things..

DO NOT USE OR MODIFY THEM UNLESS YOU'RE SUBMITTING THEM TO THIS MOD.

If you absolutely want to use them, check the links and the text files, find who owns them and either buy them, attribute them or get them for free depending on their license.

I am not responsible for copyright problems on your behalf, you have been warned.

Most of them are bought from here:
